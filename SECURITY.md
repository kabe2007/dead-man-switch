# Security Policy

As a general rule, an issue is a security vulnerability if it could lead to:

* Loss of data
* Loss of privacy
* Censorship
* Any "ordinary" security problem, such as remote code execution or invalid memory access

In general, use your best judgement in determining whether an issue is a security issue.
If not, go ahead and post it to the public issue tracker.

**If you believe you are aware of a security issue**, please contact Jose Storopoli at
`jose@storopoli.com`.
